1. Install Pspell using following command;
	sudo apt-get install php7.0-pspell

2. Create a file called dictionary.txt in your home directory. This file contains the keywords related with "coep" which normal english dictionary doesn't have. So the newly added words will be available in our spell checker application.

3. Install the text file in aspell:
	sudo aspell --lang=en create master /usr/lib/aspell/dictionary.rws < dictionary.txt

4. Now go to the aspell directory:
	 cd /usr/lib/aspell/
5. Then edit: sudo vi en.multi and add this line: add dictionary.rws
